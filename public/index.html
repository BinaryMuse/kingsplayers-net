        <p><strong>Harvey</strong> written by Mary Chase, directed by Wyleen Luoma</p>
        <p>When Elwood P. Dowd starts to introduce his imaginary friend, Harvey, a six-and-a-half-foot rabbit, to guests at a society party, his sister, Veta, has seen as much of his eccentric behavior as she can tolerate. She decides to have him committed to a sanitarium. Problems arise when Veta herself is mistakenly assumed to be on the verge of lunacy. When Elwood shows up at the sanitarium looking for his lost friend Harvey, it seems that the mild-mannered Elwood's delusion has had a strange influence on more than one of the doctors.</p>
