Kings Players
=============

This is the new site for the [Kings Players](http://kingsplayers.net/), a
local theater group from Hanford, California. `shows.yaml` defines all the
data for the shows, and is the only file that should need to be modified
when a new season rolls around (other than the show images in
`public/images/`).
