  description: "Faced with losing the Last Chance Inn once again, Ma and Pa Culpepper turn to glamorous Sahara Hartburn. Sahara pays off their loan with money from a \"well-heeled admirer\" and promptly takes over the inn. Transformed into the Hartburn Hotel, the place becomes a residence for young ladies with a \"no men allowed upstairs\" policy. Sahara schemes to find a scandal that will give her new venture some publicity, and finds it when the new schoolteacher, Polly Sincere, is paid a visit by her dapper and devoted boyfriend, Jasper Jones - in her room! To escape, Jasper dresses as a girl and poses as \"Jasmine Sincere,\" Polly's sister. Complications arise when a visiting sheriff falls for \"Jasmine\" and \"her\" sudden disappearance leads Sahara to accuse Polly of murder! An attempt to clear Polly's name, an outrageous chase, and the search for a bank robber all conspire to bring the play to a surprising - and side-splitting - conclusion. Full evening."

  description: "The scene is a fishing lodge in rural Georgia often visited by \"Froggy\" LeSeuer, a British demolition expert. This time \"Froggy\" has brought along a friend, a pathologically shy young man named Charlie who is overcome with fear at the thought of making conversation with strangers. So \"Froggy,\" before departing, tells all assembled that Charlie is from an exotic foreign country and speaks no English. Once alone the fun really begins, as Charlie overhears more than he should—the evil plans of a sinister, two-faced minister and his redneck associateand many other damaging revelations made with the thought that Charlie doesn't understand a word being said. That he does fuels the nonstop hilarity of the play."
