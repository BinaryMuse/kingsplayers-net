  description: "Mrs. Savage has been left ten million dollars by her husband
    and wants to make the best use of it, in spite of the efforts of her
    grown-up stepchildren to get their hands on it.They know that the
    widow's wealth is now in negotiable securities, and seeing they
    cannot get hold of it, commit her to a &quot;sanatorium.&quot;
    But Mrs. Savage is determined to establish a fund to help others realize
    their hopes and dreams. In the sanatorium she meets various social misfits
    who just cannot adjust themselves to life.The dominant mood is high comedy,
    and the audience is left with a feeling that the neglected virtues of
    kindness and affection have not been entirely lost in a world that
    seems motivated at times only by greed and dishonesty."

  description: "Easily recognized as one of Williams' best work,
    this play is an enduring classic. In a plantation house, a
    family celebrates the sixty-fifth birthday of Big Daddy. The mood
    is somber, despite the festivities, because a number of evils poison
    the gaiety: greed, sins of the past and desperate, clawing hopes for
    the future spar with one another as the knowledge that Big Daddy is dying
    slowly makes the rounds. Maggie, Big Daddy's daughter-in-law, wants to
    give him the news that she's finally become pregnant by Big Daddy's favorite
    son, Brick, but Brick won't cooperate in Maggie's plans and prefers to
    stay in a mild alcoholic haze the entire length of his visit. Swarming
    around Maggie and Brick are their intrusive, conniving relatives, all
    eager to see Maggie put in her place and Brick tumbled from his position
    of most-beloved son."
