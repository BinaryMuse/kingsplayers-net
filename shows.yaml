  description: "When Elwood P. Dowd starts to introduce his imaginary friend,
    Harvey, a six-and-a-half-foot rabbit, to guests at a society party, his
    sister, Veta, has seen as much of his eccentric behavior as she can
    tolerate. She decides to have him committed to a sanitarium. Problems
    arise when Veta herself is mistakenly assumed to be on the verge of
    lunacy. When Elwood shows up at the sanitarium looking for his lost
    friend Harvey, it seems that the mild-mannered Elwood's delusion has had
    a strange influence on more than one of the doctors."
