  description: "The Kings Players proudly present a reprise of the first show ever produced by our organization. Opal Kronkie, a
    middle-aged recluse, lives in a tumbledown mansion. The general disarray of her establishment is aggravated by the fact that Opal collects
    things. Opal is also an optimist, for no matter how mean her \"friends\" - Opal responds with unfailing kindness and an abiding faith.
    Into her world comes Gloria, Bradford and Solomon, three purveyors of bogus perfume on the lam from the authorities. Opal's
    menage is the perfect hideout and Opal, herself, might be the remedy for their shattered finances. They decide that what she
    needs is plenty of insurance, a rapid demise, and three beneficiaries. Attempted murder wouldn't seem to be funny, but in Mr.
    Patrick's magic hands it is uproarious."

  description: "There's a hot new beauty craze that's driving the men of Lost Creek mad. It's the beehive hairdo, and the higher the hair, the better.
    Dixie, a beauty shop owner and a master of beehives, has been inundated with customers who are desperate for high hair. Eager to
    win the heart of Avis Crum--a 90-year-old womanizer who happens to be the only available bachelor in Lost Creek--Granny
    Rose and Wider Snipes decide to get themselves a beehive since \"There ain't nothin' more sexy to a man than a woman with high
    hair.\" Determined to become a beehive master herself, Linda Jean sets out to learn the art of the beehive by practicing on neighborhood scarecrows. In the meantime, a couple of city slickers arrive in Lost Creek looking to sign up organ donors. The hospitable folk
    of Lost Creek are more than willing to oblige. These Down-Home characters are eccentric but bring a sense of charm."

  description: "In the middle of a howling snowstorm, a bus out of Kansas City pulls up at a cheerful roadside diner. All roads are blocked, and
    four or five weary travelers are going to have to hole up until morning. Cherie, a nightclub chanteuse in a sparkling gown and a
    seedy fur-trimmed jacket, is the passenger with most to worry about. She's been pursued, made love to and finally kidnapped
    by a twenty-one-year-old cowboy with a ranch of his own and the romantic methods of an unusually headstrong bull. The
    belligerent cowhand is right behind her, ready to sling her over his shoulder and carry her, alive and kicking, all the way to
    Montana."
